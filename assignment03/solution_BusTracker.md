# BusTracker

Here again, a setup function has been freated first.
Then, `testMapUpdate` has been created to check that the map is correctly updated.
Later, `testNotificationSent` and `testNotificationNotSent` have been created to check that the correct notifications are (not) sent.
Lastly, `testGPSFailure` has been created to check the handling of GPS failure.
